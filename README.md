# exarch

Exarch is a static site generator and server for the [Gemini
protocol](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/), which is intended as a
lightweight alternative to HTTP and HTTPS. exarch's main goal is to be
*compatible* with existing static site generators, so you can serve simple
markdown sites over both HTTPS and Gemini with minimal configuration.

## what's in a name?

Gemini made me think of twins, and experienced Magic: the Gathering players
know that [twins](https://scryfall.com/card/mm2/129/splinter-twin) and
[exarchs](https://scryfall.com/card/cma/36/deceiver-exarch) go great together.
